# Errata for _Fundamentals of Fiber Orientation_

By Charles L. Tucker III, Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign


This repository lists errors and corrections for the book _Fundamentals of Fiber Orienation: Description, Measurement and Prediction_, C. L. Tucker, Hanser, Munich, 2022.
If you find errors in the book you can notify me by e-mail to ctucker@illinois.edu, and I will update the errata list.  

A set of Matlab functions to do many common calculations related to fiber orientation and mechanical property modeling is available at
